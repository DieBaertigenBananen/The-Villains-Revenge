Was geht???


Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring bananaphone 
Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring bananaphone

I've got this feeling, so appealing 
For us to get together and sing, sing !

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring bananaphone 
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding donanaphone

It grows in bunches 
I've got my hunches 
It's the best, beats the rest 
Cellular, Modular, Interactive odular

Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring bananaphone 
Ping pong ping pong ping pong ping pananaphone

It’s no baloney 
It’s ain’t a phoney 
My cellular, bananular phone

Don’t need quarters, don’t need dimes 
To call a friend of mine 
Don’t need computers or TV 
To have a real good time 
I call for pizza, I call my cat 
I call the White House, have a chat 
I place a call around the world 
Operator get me Beijing jing jing jing


Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring bananaphone 
Ying yang ying yang ying yang ying yananaphone

It’s a real live mama and papaphone 
A brother and a sister and a dogaphone 
A grandpa phone and a grandma phone too, oh yeah 
My cellular, bananular phone

Bananaphone, ring ring ring It’s a phone with a peal 
Bananaphone, ring ring ring Now you can have your phone and eat it too 
Bananaphone, ring ring ring this song drives me, bananas 
Bananaphone, ring ring ring
